# Week 2: Memory Management in C++ for Financial Applications

## Overview

In Week 2, we'll dive into memory management in C++, focusing on techniques and patterns that are particularly relevant for high-performance financial applications. We'll explore how proper memory management can significantly impact the performance of trading systems and other financial software.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Understand memory models** in C++ and how they affect performance in financial applications
2. **Implement custom memory allocators** tailored for financial data structures
3. **Design memory pools and arenas** to minimize allocation overhead in critical paths
4. **Develop lock-free data structures** suitable for high-frequency trading systems
5. **Analyze and optimize memory usage patterns** in financial applications

## Materials

- Presentation transcript (will be available in Resources/Slides)
- Code examples (will be available in Resources/Code_Examples)
- Recommended readings (listed below)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Custom Allocator for Order Book

Implement a custom allocator for an order book data structure that minimizes memory fragmentation and allocation overhead. The allocator should be optimized for the pattern of frequent insertions and deletions typical in order book management.

### Exercise 2: Memory Pool for Time Series Data

Design and implement a memory pool for storing and processing time series financial data. The pool should efficiently handle variable-length time series and provide fast access patterns for common financial calculations.

### Exercise 3: Lock-Free Queue for Market Data

Implement a lock-free queue suitable for passing market data between threads in a trading system. Benchmark its performance against a standard mutex-protected queue under various load scenarios.

## Homework Assignment

1. Extend your custom allocator from Exercise 1 to include memory usage statistics and diagnostics.
2. Compare the performance of your memory pool implementation against standard allocation strategies using realistic financial data volumes.
3. Write a short report (1-2 pages) analyzing the memory usage patterns in a financial application of your choice and suggesting optimizations.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your code files via the course repository
- Include a README.md with instructions on how to compile and run your code
- For the report, submit a PDF document
- Deadline: End of Week 3
